<p><strong>Major(s):</strong> Computing Technology and Information Systems; Experience Design</p>

<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Greensboro, NC</p>

<p><strong>Future Goals:</strong> Go into Web Design & Development</p> 
	<p>I want to use the knowledge that I will have about design, accessibility, and emotional impact from Experience Design to create meaningful and usable websites. I will use my knowledge from CTIS to understand what is happening “behind the scenes”, and be able to contribute to the developmental side of creating websites.</p> 

<p><strong>Favorite Movie:</strong> I love a lot of Marvel movies, but I don’t think I have a favorite one. If I had to choose, it would probably be Iron Man.</p> 

<p><strong>Favorite Color:</strong> Purple</p> 

<p><strong>Favorite Subject:</strong> CTIS & XD classes</p>

<p><strong>Favorite Experiences at Guilford so far:</strong> 
My favorite experience that is not academically related was attending the Hypnotist performance. It blew my mind that people I knew were no longer in control of their actions. It was very mesmerizing and I would recommend to anyone that they see it at least once!</p>
