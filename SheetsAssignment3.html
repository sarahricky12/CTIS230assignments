Major(s): Computing Technology and Information Systems; Experience Design

Hometown: Greensboro, NC

Future Goals: Go into Web Design & Development 
	I want to use the knowledge that I will have about design, accessibility, and emotional impact from Experience Design to create meaningful and usable websites. I will use my knowledge from CTIS to understand what is happening “behind the scenes”, and be able to contribute to the developmental side of creating websites. 

Favorite Movie: I love a lot of Marvel movies, but I don’t think I have a favorite one. If I had to choose, it would probably be Iron Man. 

Favorite Color: Purple 

Favorite Subject: CTIS & XD classes 

Favorite Experiences at Guilford so far: 
My favorite experience that is not academically related was attending the Hypnotist performance. It blew my mind that people I knew were no longer in control of their actions. It was very mesmerizing and I would recommend to anyone that they see it at least once!
